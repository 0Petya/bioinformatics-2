**Review of: A stochastic model of size control in the budding yeast cell cycle**

Peter Tran

In this paper, Ahmadian _et al_. develop a stochastic model of cell size control in budding yeast, and compare their results against a deterministic model from another research group, which is a traditional approach. The authors claim the issue with deterministic models is that they have a difficult time to generalize to account for cell-to-cell variabilities and that instead, a stochastic model can hone in on the variability to describe stochastic phenotypes. The deterministic model used by the authors is from Chen _et al_. where it is a molecular regulatory network, focusing on Cdc28 as the main regular of the budding yeast cell cycle. Chen's model then describes the protein regulatory network, not the mRNAs; but the authors indicate that there is evidence that the noise described earlier results from the low copy number of mRNAs. The rest of the paper goes into detail the stochastic model developed by the authors and its comparison with the deterministic model. In conclusion, the authors developed a model that can include the transcripts of the early G1 phase, which allows them to study the noise in that phase and how it affects the size control mechanism. The downside of the model is that it can get computationally expensive.
