**Review of: Modeling and Simulation Tools: From Systems Biology to Systems Medicine**

Peter Tran

In this paper, Olivier et al. set out to describe the modeling and simulation landscape in systems biology and systems medicine. They begin with a description of what modeling is and come to terms with a definition for models: "a model is a quantitative, mechanistic description of a biological system that can be described as a set of coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs)". The authors then identify three different ways models can be encoded: in mathematical equations, in programming languages/software, and with interactive encoding such as a custom model description language (like COPASI). Then they talk about model instantiation where one needs to manipulate and analyze a model by using either a mathematical environment (MATLAB, R) or dedicated simulation software (COPASI), where a computational mathematical environment may be slow and difficult, but is extensible and automatable. The authors go on to talk about model exchange, where models can be shared and modified depending on the context. The authors believe that the "next generation" of modeling will involve highly specialized tools that will be composed to complete a large task. To facilitate this, the authors state that a robust set of standards must be adopted, and they go over several different approaches. The authors then go on to give an overview of several different tools used for modeling (COPASI, COBRA, SBW, CBMPy, FAME, and CBMP). The next section of the paper gives a description of modeling and its use in drug discovery, development, and pharmacometrics.
