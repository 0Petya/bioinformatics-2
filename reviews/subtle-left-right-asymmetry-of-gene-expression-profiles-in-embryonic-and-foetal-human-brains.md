**Review of: Subtle left-right asymmetry of gene expression profiles in embryonic and foetal human brains**

Peter Tran

In this paper, Francks _et al_. set out to examine the genetic basis for the laterality observed in the human brain. They do so by using RNA-seq to contrast gene expression in each hemisphere of a fetus. What they found is that a few genes were significantly differentially expressed, but most were only slightly different, and that brain asymmetry occurs before 5 weeks post conception.

While the authors noticed the asymmetry, they also noticed that it was different for different brain structures. The authors classified genes into those that increase expression with age (_fast_) and those that don't (_slow_). Then in the brain stem, for example, the midbrain on the right side of the brain was _faster_ but the spinal cord on the left side of the brain was _faster_. This is shown again in the anterior sub-structures as well. This leads the authors to think that different brain structures have different laterality developmental histories, and perhaps laterality is not determined by one mechanism but multiple mechanisms.

For RNA-seq analysis, they quality controlled the reads with FastQC, aligned to a UCSC genome with Hisat2, and used RSEM for quantification.
