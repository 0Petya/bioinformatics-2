**Review of: Massive metagenomic data analysis using abundance-based machine learning**

Peter Tran

In this paper, authors Ahn _et al_. leverage machine learning methods in metagenomic data analysis of subway systems from different cities on the planet, provided by the MetaSUB international consortium. The goal is to predict what city a metagenomic sample came from. The authors attempted two different approaches in order to reduce the computational load due to the massive size of the data: read-based and assembly-based strategies. They analyzed the effect of two different machine learning algorithms: linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and random forests (RF). Default parameters were used for LDA, and a parameter search for 50 different RF classifiers was performed. Both models were evaluated with 10-fold cross-validation using accuracy as the metric, and the authors held out 30 samples for final testing.

For read-based prediction, LDA resulted in very low accuracy at ~20%. The authors move on to test RF, and were able to get 91% accuracy at a 95% CI [70%, 91%] accuracy with subsample technique optimization. With assembly-based prediction, the results dropped to 71.8% and 88.5% accuracy for LDA and RF respectively. These accuracies are validation accuracies, obtained from the cross-validation. The authors did also attempt a support vector machine and multi-layer perceptron but to low results. On the test set, for read-based RF was able to identify 18 out of 30 samples, and for assembly-based 20 out of 30.

One critique that could be given is that figure S3 shows the parameter search for the RF model. It seems to indicate that the authors only tuned one parameter: the number of estimators. While one of the most important parameters of an RF classifier, there are many more that should be searched. The maximum depth of each tree, for example, is a very important parameter to tune to avoid overfitting. In sklearn, the default setting for maximum depth is none, allowing the trees to completely overfit themselves if they wish. Perhaps some deeper parameter tuning, such as with maximum depth, could close the gap between the validation and testing accuracies the authors noted.

In closing, this was a great paper showing how machine learning methods can be applied to metagenomics. Given the absolutely massive size of these data sets, this gives researchers a great way to tackle them and to try and gain some useful knowledge.
