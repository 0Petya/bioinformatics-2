**Review of: Discovery of a novel coronavirus associated with the recent pneumonia outbreak in humans and its potential bat origin**

Peter Tran

With the recent coronavirus epidemic, many labs are scrambling to learn as much as they can about it in order to best combat the spread. In this paper, Shi _et al_. claim to have identified the novel coronavirus (nCoV-2019) as having its origin in bats. The authors begin by explaining how after the SARS outbreak, SARSr-CoV have been discovered in bats. After nCoV-2019 was sequenced, it was compared to the sequence of SARS-CoV with a 79.5% sequence identity. Furthermore, seven conserved replicase domains that were used for CoV species classification were found to have a 94.6 sequence identity between nCoV-2019 and SARS-CoV. The authors then found an RdRp (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) region from a bat coronavirus (BatCoV RaTG13), which showed a 96.2 sequence identity. To demonstrate that this sequence similarity is not because they are paralogs but orthologs, the authors performed a phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1c) and showed that nCoV-2019 is a clade that split off from other bat CoVs.

Furthermore, the authors developed a qPCR assay to detect nCoV-2019, and tested on swab samples from humans and identified that the virus was transmitted through the airway, but just based on a sample of seven patients. The authors also isolated nCoV-2019 in Vero and Huh7 cells, where they observed cytopathogenic effects. They show that nCoV-2019 can be cross-neutralized by horse anti-SARS-CoV serum, further indicating the relationship between the two.

It could be criticized that this paper lacked focus, with the first half focusing very heavily on their work in identifying the nCoV-2019's evolutionary origin, and the second half focusing on some basic biology of the virus and its activity _in vitro_. Considering the circumstance though, it is preferable that the authors release all information in a timely manner so that nCoV-2019 can be understood quickly.
