**Review of: Scalable Open Science Approach for Mutation Calling of Tumor Exomes Using Multiple Genomic Pipelines**

Peter Tran

This paper by Ellrott _et al_. and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) network is more a less a PSA and short experiment in leveraging cloud computing technologies to assist in creating reproducible research in terms of bioinformatics pipelines. For the experiment, the authors focus on the variant calling of genomic samples from both tumor and normal tissues for a variety of cancer types. The raw data produced that the authors examined were to 400 TB in size, which is extremely massive and must be processed with some sort of high-performance computation. This led the authors to design methodology that would allow for the distribution of computation as well as reproducibility of research. Their workflow is comprised of as follows: using containers to bundle dependencies and tools to ensure everything required to run a pipeline exists in any new environment (e.g. Docker); tool wrappers so that each program is run will have its arguments, outputs, and parameters specified for ease of use and reusability (also serves as documentation); and a pipeline description which is the documentation for how all tools fit together and how to use it. As a result, the authors were able to easily deploy their analyses to cloud computing requirements in a scalable way that required minimal setup time, as well as were able to easily collaborate with others and eventually share their results that can be reproduced by anyone with minimal effort.
